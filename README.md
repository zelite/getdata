This is my project for the "Getting and Cleaning Data" Coursera course.


# Project Tasks

The project task is to start with this dataset: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

And clean it to make it a [tidy dataset](http://www.jstatsoft.org/v59/i10/).

Specifically, these are the instructions:

>You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
>1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
>2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
>3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
>4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
>5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
