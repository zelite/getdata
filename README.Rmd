This is my project for the "Getting and Cleaning Data" Coursera course.


# Project Tasks

The project task is to start with this dataset: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

And clean it to make it a [tidy dataset](http://www.jstatsoft.org/v59/i10/).
