This dataset records data from the accelerometer and gyroscope of a smartphone attached to volunteers while performing several activities. The acitivities include WALKING, WALKING UPSTAIRS, WALKING DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING and LAYING.

The dataset presented on this repository is a _tidy_ version which summarizes the main measurements.

This tidy version is organized in the following way:

* From the original dataset, only variables corresponding to applying a mean value ( mean() ), standard deviation ( std() ) and weighted average of the frequency components ( meanFreq() ) were taken. 
* This tidy dataset is a _long_ dataset with the following columns: ``r names(tidyData)``.
    + The `subject` column is identifies the volunteers with a number, going from `r min(tidyData$subject)` to `r max(tidyData$subject)`.
    + The `activity` column describes the activity being performed by the subject. It can have the following values: `r levels(tidyData$activity)`.
    + The `variable` column describes the variable recorded. Check the next section for more details about the variables.
    + The `average` column has the average value of the `variable` of the `subject` performing the `activity`.
